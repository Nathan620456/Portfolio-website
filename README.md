This website contains some html files, css files only one javascript file because for some reason javascript wouldn't work as an external file on vs when trying to upload to google.

This website was just for a project to do and I believe I have completed it. 

If anyone knows what to do to make the javascript activate on the google webpage then go ahead and make the changes necsessary to do so as long as all the previous content is still on the files.

the image files are on my computer so I am not sure whether they will appear on this code so sorry about that.
